# OPT-Advantage 📈

**Goal:** Empower international students to find the best U.S. universities based on OPT-to-H‑1B success rates and ROI.

## 🚀 Overview
International students (like me!) want a roadmap: which universities are most likely to lead to job opportunities? This data-driven project analyzes OPT and H‑1B outcomes to help students make smarter enrollment decisions.

## 🔍 Key Metrics
- H‑1B Approval Rate by University
- Estimated ROI (Approval Rate ÷ Tuition Cost)
- Program-level insights (e.g., STEM vs non-STEM)
